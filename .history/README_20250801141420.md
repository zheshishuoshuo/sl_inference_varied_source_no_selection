# wait for exec end of Aeta

# now care about the mmdist


# target

- use right Msps relation
- see why multi peak (even small)

# Next step：
01. ~~fix error because of __init__ ~~

0. consistent model---new branch
1. check if all sps error done    ----？
2. think about all likelihood use tabulate
3. directly fit the source data
4. extended model
5. varid source
6. undetected source
7. 0 In 4D parameter space, perform large-scale random sampling first, then iteratively select subsets to build the interpolator and expand as needed to balance accuracy and efficiency.

7. microlensing




# another line

- why result on jupyter still have multi peak?


# attention:

know no relation between Mh and Re in the data generated

# Pipeline to generate all magnification distributions

## generate samples ($\kappa$,$\gamma$,$s$)

1. a set, oversampled
2.
